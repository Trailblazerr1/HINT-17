# Helping Hand ( cause everyone needs one )
It's an android app based on react native ( Facebook App framework ) , which helps to bring people and NGO's on the same page.
Thus bonding them together.

The project helps to tackle the problem of rampant food wastage ongoing in ceremonies and places of
large consumptions ( such as mess ).Apart from that we aim to make donations easier for the common 
man to make as well as for the NGO's to collect.

The technical end comprises of an android app and a django backend. There would be profiles of users and 
NGO's alike.We would also like to make rating the NGO and feedbacks.

### Technical Summary
1. Android App    -- React Native  ( app backend and UI )
2. django backend -- All the heavy lifting
3. NodeJS         -- App server


### Node Libraries
