This is for you.
You, snuggled in your oversized tee, lying prone on ur mattress, your fingers scrolling endlessly in an unprecedented rhythm.
Stop scrolling.
A vey happy your day to you.. no, no, no.
A very happy our day to us.
Ask me why?
Not everyone's fingers have evolved to act as a centrifuge, not everyone dances like a madman in the middle of the crowd, not everyone plans for a dinner at 4 in the morning, not everyone embraces their crevices so swiftly, not everyone exhibits their white stains to the class, not everyone has 'that pinkish color' as their favourite, not everyone is a copy of a copy of a copy..
And the world is going no-where with all those sane people around.
Cheers.
